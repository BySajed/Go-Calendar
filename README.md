Technical Description:
Our project is build only with one package (main) but each function is in a different file. This method make hte debugging part easier. Here is the content of each file:

main.go:
    - start menu
    - start connection to database
    - notification
    - 

newEvent.go:
    - creation new events
    - upload event in database

showEvent.go:
    - show an event (or all events)
    - filter your research

modifyEvent.go:
    - modify an existing event
    - update the event in the database

deleteEvent.go:
    - delete an existing event
    - update event in database

export.go:
    - export/convert the file in JSON or CSV

This code work like a tree structure. The user will chose an option, and the switch in the main will follow the way. When the user finished, he will come back to the origin of the tree (main.go)

Obviously, we have incorporate errors management into our code in forecasting possible user errors.
